## Setup
### Before the Workshop Begins
1. Install the following software if you donâ€™t yet have them. If you do have these installed, skip to #2:
   1. **R** version 3.5+ (Current: 3.6.1) 
   2. **RStudio** version 1.2+ (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) OR use RStudio Cloud (https://rstudio.cloud)
2. Ensure that your version of **R** is 3.5+. The latest version is 3.6.1.
   To check your R version, type in your console:
   `version`
3. Check your **RStudio** version. It should be v1.2+
Open RStudio. In the top menu bar click: RStudio > About RStudio > 
4. Install **tidyverse** & **here**: `install.packages(c("tidyverse", "here"))`

#### For Windows Users
[Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0PjTAylwoU) <br>
Install R by downloading and running [this `.exe` file from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm).
Also, please install the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).
Note that if you have separate user and admin accounts, you should run the installers as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select "Run as administrator" instead of double-clicking).
Otherwise problems may occur later, for example when installing R packages.

#### For Mac Users
[Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-ly3kyxwEg)
Install R by downloading and running [this `.pkg` file from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-latest.pkg).
Also, please install the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

#### For Linux Users
You can download the binary files for your distribution from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/index.html).
Or you can use your package manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu run `sudo apt-get install r-base` and for Fedora run `sudo dnf install R`).
Also, please install the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).
